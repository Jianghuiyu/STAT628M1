    "## [Introduction]\n",
    "### 1. Motivation:\n",
    "In modern society, people begin to pursue healthier lifestyles and focus on personal health. As a measure of obesity, body fat percentage plays an important role in various health outcomes.Our project aims at building a model a simple, robust, accurate and precise“rule-of-thumb” method to estimate percentage of body fat based on the 252-men data set, meaning that our model only predicts the male.\n",

    "### 2. Background of body fat and the data set\n",
    "#### [About body fat]\n",
    "From the achievement of previous studies, we can get the formula for estimating the body fat B(%)\n",
    "<center>Percentage of Body Fat $(i.e. 100 \\times B) = \\frac{495}{D} - 450$, D = Body Density $(gm/cm^{3})$ (1)</center>\n",
    "\n",
    "#### [About the data set]\n",
    "Our data is based on 252 men and has 14 independent variables: \n",
    "\n",
    "Age(years), Weight(lbs), Height(inches), Adiposity(bmi), Neck circumference(cm), Chest circumference(cm), Abdomen circumference(cm), Hip circumference(cm), Thigh circumference(cm), Knee circumference(cm), Ankle circumference(cm), Biceps (extended) circumference(cm), Forearm circumference(cm), Wrist circumference(cm); one dependent variable: Body fat B(%); and Density, here, we think it is meaningless to our model.\n",

    "\n",
    "![Image](https://github.com/Jianghuiyu/STAT628M1/blob/master/Image/Linearnity.png?raw=true)\n",
    "\n",
    "From the graphs, we can find a linear relationship between BODYFAT and the rest variables(except HEIGHT); AGE has a weak linear relationship with BODYFAT and the other variables, like ABDOMEN and WEIGHT, have strong linear relationships with BODYFAT. Thus, we choose the linear regression model to estimate the body fat.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Our model assumption**:1.Linear relationship 2.Multivariate normality 3.No or little multicollinearity 4.No auto-correlation 5.Homoscedasticity\n",

    "#### 2.1 Unreasonable record deletion\n",

    "\n",
    "<center>BODYFAT(182nd)=495/1.1089-450=-3.612</center>\n",
    "\n",
    "We notice that the 182nd has bodyfat=0;and we calculate the body fat with the density formula (1) and the result is negative. Thus, we regard this record as one unreasonable observarion and delete it.\n",
    "#### 2.2. Outlier detection\n",
    "Each time we throw one sample based on the cook distance until the value of cook distance is not greater than 2p/n.\n",
    "\n",
    "First time we drop the 42nd record,\n",

    "![Image](https://github.com/Jianghuiyu/STAT628M1/blob/master/Image/cookdistance42nd.png?raw=true)\n",
    "\n",
    "Interpretation: the 42nd observation has the biggest cook distance value and he is really short, thus we delete this record.\n",
    "\n",
    "Second time we drop the 39th record,\n",
    "\n",
    "![Image](https://github.com/Jianghuiyu/STAT628M1/blob/master/Image/39th.png?raw=true)\n",

    "\n",
    "Interpretation: the 39th observation has the biggest cook distance value and he is really short, thus we delete this record.\n",
    "After droping the 42th and 39th sample, the data set looks good for us."

    "\n",
    "Since the BIC is more conservative, we use the stepwise model based on BIC criterion.\n",

    "\n",
    "<center>BIC: $ln(n)k-2ln(\\hat{L})$</center>\n",
    "\n",
    "The result of BIC shows abdomen, weight, and wrist are the most important variables for interpret the bodyfat.We can get the model,\n",

    "We use the grid search to determine the alpha based on the regularization path plot. Next, cross validation is adopted to choose the proper lambda. According to the graphs about the regularization path and Cross-validation, we can get the final model selects the age, height, adiposity, abdomen, and wrist. We can get the model,\n",

    "<center>$(Body Fat\\%)=5.717+0.736Abdomen-0.336Height-1.692Wrist+0.045Age-0.091 ;\\ \\ Multiple R^{2}:0.7341$</center>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3.3 Which one to choose?\n",
    "\n",
    "For the sake of simplicity, we choose the stepwise model based on BIC criterion as our final model. First of all, the performance of the regressions does not differ a lot between each model. Each model’s R square are very close. Both AIC and elastic net pick too many variables. Secondly, it is strange that some estimations in the regularization path of elastic net change the sign as the penalty grows. In addition, the cross-validation only care about the mse. However, we also want to make some inference in our model and in that case, cross validation might not very suitable to use."
